<h1> Zambia Real Estate Web Scraper </h1>

<description> This repository contains a collection of web scrapers built with Scrapy
  to extract structured property data from various Zambian real estate
  websites. The goal is to gather information such as property type,
  price, bedrooms, location, and area from multiple online platforms into
  a consistent, usable format. (Please note that the data is not cleaned)

  Each scraper targets a specific website and is designed to navigate
  through listing pages, follow individual property links, and collect
  detailed attributes. The project serves as a central place to organize
  all scrapers related to property listings across Zambia.

  This repository will continue to grow as I identify and add support for
  more real estate websites. Expect ongoing updates, improvements, and
  new spiders for different platforms. </description>
